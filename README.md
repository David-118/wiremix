# why I made this
This project is a fork of `https://github.com/tsowell/wiremix` used for a project of mine.
wiremix was chosen because, inspite of my limited experiance with rust, the code is very modular and easy to follow

I decided to upload this here because I think it is cool.

Massive thanks to tsowell and other people who have contribued upstream for making this possible

I have made some small modifcations to help make it better for a small screen:
* larger bars on deafult charset
* red (by default) bars to clearly show a device is muted at a quick glance
* Added a favorite tab to show important Devices/Nodes at a glance.
* Added large touch freindly buttons for mute, increase and reducing volume



# wiremix

wiremix is a simple TUI audio mixer for PipeWire. You can use it to adjust
volumes, route audio between devices and applications, and configure audio
device settings like input/output ports and profiles.

wiremix's interface is more or less a clone of the wonderful
[ncpamixer](https://github.com/fulhax/ncpamixer) which was itself inspired by
pavucontrol, so users of either should find it familiar.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

wiremix depends on Rust and the PipeWire libraries. To install all
dependencies:

* Ubuntu: `sudo apt install cargo libpipewire-0.3-dev pkg-config clang`
* Debian: `sudo apt install libpipewire-0.3-dev pkg-config clang` 
* OpenSUSE: `sudo zypper install pipewire-devel pkgconf clang`
(you will also need to install a somewhat recent Rust toolchain - rustup is one way)

Clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/David-118/wiremix.git`

build project
```sh
cd wiremix
cargo build -r
```

This will create an executable `target/release/wiremix` that you can do what what you want with


## Quick Start

1. Run `wiremix` to launch with default settings
2. Use mouse and keyboard bindings to operate the mixer
   - ? to display keyboard bindings
   - Arrow keys or hjkl to navigate and adjust volume
   - Tab or HL to change tabs
   - c to open a dropdown to route audio to a different destination
   - m to mute/unmute
   - d set an input or output device as the default source/sink

## Command-line Options

```
PipeWire mixer

Usage: wiremix [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -c, --config <FILE>
          Override default config file path
  -r, --remote <NAME>

      --no-mouse
          Disable mouse support
      --mouse
          Enable mouse support

      --no-lazy-capture
          Monitor peak levels of all nodes
      --lazy-capture

          peaks appear with a slight delay)
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

Command-line options override corresponding settings in the configuration file.

## Input Bindings

Everything except quitting can also be done with the mouse. Some of the
less-intuitive mouse controls are:

* Click the numeric volume percentage to toggle muting.
* Scroll through lists and dropdowns with the mouse wheel or click on scroll
  buttons (default appearance: `•••`)
* Right-click to set as the default source/sink

## Configuration

wiremix can be configured through a TOML configuration file.

It searches for the configuration file in these locations (in order of
precedence):

1. Path specified on the command-line via `-c`/`--config`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wiremix/wiremix.toml`
3. `~/.config/wiremix/wiremix.toml`

This README only describes basic capabilities. Please see
[wiremix.toml](./wiremix.toml) in this repository for detailed documentation on
configuring wiremix. It also provides a reference for all of wiremix's
defaults.

The configuration specified in the file is merged with wiremix's defaults, so
it only needs to specify the options that need to be changed. It is recommended
to start with an empty configuration file and use this repository's
[wiremix.toml](./wiremix.toml) as a reference.

### Basic Configuration

Everything that can specified on the command-line has a corresponding option in
the configuration file.

```toml
#remote = "pipewire-0"
#fps = 60.0
mouse = true
peaks = "auto"
char_set = "default"
theme = "default"
tab = "playback"
max_volume_percent = 150.0
enforce_max_volume = false
lazy_capture = false
```

### Keybindings

The configuration file can customize keyboard controls for all wiremix actions.
See [wiremix.toml](./wiremix.toml) for more details.

#### Examples

```toml
keybindings = [
 # Use ncpamixer-style absolute volume bindings
 { key = { Char = "`" }, action = "Nothing" },
 { key = { Char = "0" }, action = { SetAbsoluteVolume = 0.0 } },
 # Chars 1-9 already work like ncpamixer
]
```

```toml
keybindings = [
 # Use F-keys to select tabs
 { key = { F = 1 }, action = { SelectTab = 0 } },
 { key = { F = 2 }, action = { SelectTab = 1 } },
 { key = { F = 3 }, action = { SelectTab = 2 } },
 { key = { F = 4 }, action = { SelectTab = 3 } },
 { key = { F = 5 }, action = { SelectTab = 4 } },
]
```

### Character Sets

Character sets define the symbols used in the user interface. You can define
multiple character sets and switch between them using the `char_set`
configuration option or the `-s`/`--char-set` command-line argument.

There are three built-in character sets.

1. `default` is the default set. It may contain symbols that can't be rendered
   with your terminal or console.
2. `compat` uses only symbols from
   [cross-platform-terminal-characters](https://github.com/ehmicky/cross-platform-terminal-characters).
3. `extracompat` uses only ASCII symbols.

The configuration file allows for both modifying built-in character sets and
creating custom ones.

See [wiremix.toml](./wiremix.toml) for more details.

### Themes

Themes define colors and other text attributes for UI elements. They are
similar to character sets in that you can define your own themes and switch
between them with the `theme` configuration option or the `-t`/`--theme`
command-line arguments.

There are three built-in themes:

1. `default` is the default theme.
2. `nocolor` uses no color, only attributes.
3. `plain` uses only the default style - no colors or attributes. 
   Please note the default character set dose not work with theme `plain` as the same character (█) are used for volume_empty and volume_fill.

The configuration file allows for both modifying built-in themes and creating
custom ones.

See [wiremix.toml](./wiremix.toml) for more details.

### Names

You can customize how streams, endpoints, and devices are displayed in the user
interface using a template system to generate names from PipeWire properties.

It's likely that any particular naming scheme won't work well with 100% of your
software and devices, so you can also specify alternate name templates to use
for PipeWire nodes matching configurable criteria.

See [wiremix.toml](./wiremix.toml) for more details.

As I am lazy name overides system has been hijacked for the Favorites system.

#### Examples

The default naming scheme is:

```toml
[names]
stream = [ "{node:node.name}: {node:media.name}" ]
endpoint = [ "{device:device.nick}", "{node:node.description}" ]
device = [ "{device:device.nick}", "{device:device.description}" ]
```

Not all nodes and devices have the same properties present, so if multiple
naming templates are specified, wiremix will try to resolve them in order and
use the first one that works.

For ncpamixer-style names you can use:

```toml
[names]
stream = [ "{node:node.name}: {node:media.name}" ]
endpoint = [ "{node:node.description}" ]
device = [ "{device:device.description}" ]
```

I use these overrides with the default names:

```toml
# This device's device.name is truncated to "USB-C to 3.5mm Headphone Jack
# A". This override makes wiremix use device.description instead, which for
# this device is "USB-C to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter".
# The device will appear on the favorite tab above all lower prioriry devices.
[[names.overrides]]
types = [ "endpoint", "device" ]
property = "device:device.name"
value = "alsa_card.usb-Apple__Inc._USB-C_to_3.5mm_Headphone_Jack_Adapter_DWH841302FEJKLTA3-00"
templates = [ "{device:device.description}" ]
favorite = true
favorite_priority = 10

# The Spotify client's node.name is "spotify", and it also uses "Spotify" for
# media.name. This override makes wiremix use just the node.name, so it shows
# as "spotify" instead of "spotify: Spotify".
# The device will not appear in the favorite list. Prioriry must be set but will be ignored.
[[names.overrides]]
types = [ "stream" ]
property = "node:node.name"
value = "spotify"
templates = [ "{node:node.name}" ]
favorite = false
favorite_priority = 0

# mpv is also a bit redundant with the default naming scheme - it suffixes
# media.name with "- mpv". This override makes it show as "foo - mpv" instead
# of "mpv: foo - mpv".
# mpv will appear on the favorites screen under the dongle (when open).
[[names.overrides]]
types = [ "stream" ]
property = "node:node.name"
value = "mpv"
templates = [ "{node:media.name}" ]
favorite = false
favorite_priority = 0
```
